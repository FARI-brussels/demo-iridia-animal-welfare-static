    "rule1":"<b>Every day hundreds of animals are sold online in Belgium.</b> Given the large volume of ads that this represents, it seems inconceivable for a human to control each and every one of the ads posted. This is where artificial intelligence enters the game!",
    "rule2":"Rules",
    "rule3":"The goal of this game is simple, you will have to <b>classify the ads that sell animals</b> into two categories, legal ads and illegal ads.<br>To do this, you'll have to <b>analyze the image and description of the ad</b> to see if it respects the legislation. <br>",

    "rule4":"<b>To be legal</b>, an ad selling an animal online must respect all the following characteristics: ",
    "rule5":"The description must contain the following legal mention: <i>'An animal is a sentient living being and not a toy. The purchase or adoption of an animal is done in full awareness of the responsibilities of its new owner. Abandonment or negligence of an animal is an offence subject to criminal or administrative prosecution.'</i>",
    "rule6":"All ads must include a unique approval number for the seller, which always begins with the two letters HK.",
    "rule7":"The image of the ad can only contain one single animal and vendors can only sell one animal per ad.",
    "rule8":"The ad must be published from the Brussels region or Flanders, so it cannot be published from Wallonia.",
    "rule9":"It is strictly forbidden to sell animals on Facebook Marketplace.",
    "rule10":"You will <b>earn points</b> based on the <b>number of correctly classified ads</b> and the <b>time you took</b> to complete the task. You will be able to compare your score to other players as well as to the algorithm that takes care of this task in practice. <br><br><b>During this game, you will be able to compare your results with those obtained by the FARI algorithm.</b> This algorithm uses artificial intelligence technologies such as image recognition or natural language processing. In addition, the criteria presented above are a simplification of reality, in practice this algorithm is based on a dozen criteria to classify the ads for selling animals online.",
